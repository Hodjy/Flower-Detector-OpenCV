A program that uses template matching in order to find object (in this case, flowers) in greyscale images.

In order to run this program, simply download the files and run them with a python IDE.

In order to increase the algorithm sensitivity for detection, decrease the positive threshold to the minimum of 1.0,
to decrease the sensitivity increase the positive threshold to the maximum of 1.0
